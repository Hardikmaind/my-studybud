<!-- Advantages of Using the Django URL Tag:

Dynamic URLs: The URL generated by the {% url %} template tag is dynamic and adapts to changes in your URL patterns. If you ever change the URL pattern or its parameters, you don't need to update all instances of the URL in your templates manually.

Consistency: Using the template tag helps maintain consistency in your project. If you use the same URL pattern in multiple places, you ensure that they all generate the correct URLs.

Readability: The URL tag makes the template code more readable by abstracting away the details of URL construction.

Flexibility: If you need to change the structure of your URLs or add query parameters in the future, you can do so more easily with the {% url %} tag. -->
