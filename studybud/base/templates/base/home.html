<!-- Advantages of Using the Django UhRL Tag: -->


<!-- The provided text highlights the advantages of using the Django {% url %} template tag. This tag offers dynamic URLs that adapt to changes in URL patterns, ensuring that updates don't require manual adjustments throughout templates. It promotes consistency by generating correct URLs for the same pattern used in multiple places, enhances code readability by abstracting URL construction details, and provides flexibility for future structural changes or query parameter additions. -->
